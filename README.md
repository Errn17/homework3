# homework3

This was a tough one. Had to watch a lot of videos and use a lot of outside resources.
MDN and YouTube were my bestfriends for this one. I feel like my understanding of using functions and the different variables is a lot better now. Not quite where I need to be yet though.

I started out by declaring some global variables to kick it off

Then I created the different prompts to get the specified user inputs for the code to run

The if statement runs only if the user doesn't meet the password length
If the user does meet the length then the else statment will give the user various prompts to decide from
upperCase, lowerCase, sym, num

After that is where the magic happens. Based off the users input the function will grab those selections because the charSet should store them till called again.
The for loop will run based off the selections in the prompts and using the math.random and math.floor it will put together the random password

The function is then called based off the addeventlistener when the "generate password" button is clicked.
